I"x<p>Hello World! Over the last six months, I have worked to re-focus myself in Cognitive Neuroscience.
As part of this process, I decided a website would help boost my professionalism and give the community a place to learn a little
about me. This is just the beginning. I foreshadow many, many site changes and overall improvements as I continue this project. Stay tuned!</p>

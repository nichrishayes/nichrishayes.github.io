	    Below is a gif of some resting-state fMRI data that underwent bandpassing. The original gif was on a black-white colorscale generated through fsl's animate command-line tool.
	    Unfortunately, I was unable to find a way to tamper with the code to produce a red-yellow colorscaled version which I think is more exciting, thus the gif below was 
	    generated using the command-line tool Imagemagick and is not quite as clean as desired. I still think it's cool :)!

    Below is a gif of some resting-state mri data that underwent bandpassing. The original gif was on a black-white colorscale generated through fsl's animate commandline tool.
    Unfortunately, I was unable to find a way to tamper with the code to produce a Red-Yellow colorscaled version which I think is more exciting, therefore the gif below was 
    generated using the commandline tool Imagemagick and is not quite as clean as desired. Cool nonetheless!

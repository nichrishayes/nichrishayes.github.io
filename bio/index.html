	<h4> Background </h4>
	<p class="ex1">
		I was born and raised in Milwaukee, WI. When I was young I aspired to pursue higher education, but like many others wanting specific academic interests. Soccer was always a passion of mine, so finding a University supportive of my academic goals and athletic desires was important to me. The <a href="http://uwm.edu/">University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM)</a> was the place for me.

	<h4> Undergrad </h4>
	<p class="ex1">
		When I was growing up, mental illness was not a stranger. One of my close friends, and several relatives were impacted by mental illness. These experiences provided me with real-world perspective, and triggered my interests in human behavior, the mind, and eventually the brain. When I arrived at <a href="http://uwm.edu/">UWM</a>, my undergraduate studies were broadly distributed because I was unsure about what would evolve into my area of study. For much of my undergrad, I worked in a local law firm in downtown Milwaukee advancing my professional experiences while being introduced to law as I entertained the idea of law school after college. Cue Psychology; my experience in <a href="http://uwm.edu/psychology/">UWM’s undergraduate program in psychology</a> centered my preexisting interests in mental health toward topics of cognition and neuroscience. Admission into Professor Deborah Hannula’s <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mindfulofmemorylab/home">MINDfull Memory research lab,</a> and collaboration with fellow lab members
routed these interests into a sharpened scope of study. Perhaps not unexpectedly, my plans for post-graduation were muddled; I had difficulty deciding between law school and graduate school.

	<p class="ex1">
		After I completed my bachelors in <a href="http://uwm.edu/psychology/">psychology</a> at <a href="http://uwm.edu/">UWM</a> in December of 2015, I took six months off from school – working as a firm administrator at the same law firm - to find a fitting post-baccalaureate position as a professional research assistant. 
		In July of 2016, I was pleased to assume the position of Clinical Research Associate working with <a href="http://david-e-warren.me/index">Dr. David Warren, Ph.D.</a> at the <a href="https://www.unmc.edu/">University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC)</a>

	<h4> What's Next? </h4>
	<p class="ex1">
		Under the mentorship of Dr. Warren, I've been enhancing my research experience using a variety of cognitive neuroscience methods including neuroimaging, eye-tracking, and neuropsychological tests. I believe that each of my research experiences thus far has blended, giving framework for a successful career in cognitive neuroscience. Until my next big step, I carry on working toward graduate program application. More to come!

	<h4> Background </h4>
	<p class="ex1">
		I'm originally from Milwaukee, WI - that's where I was born and raised. I attended Tamarack Waldorf School from kindergarten all the way through eigth grade, and let me assure you, that was one long ride. At Tamarack, you have one teacher for all eight years, and your class size is roughly twenty students. We all, at some point or another, accidentally called our teacher mom. I grew up with pretty good hand-eye-foot coordination, playing basketball initially in gradeschool and middleschool, and also soccer from middleschool through the end of college. Soccer truly became a passion of mine - on and off the field. I'm an avid Premiere League follower. After Tamarack I moved into Pius XI High School, and then my senior year over to Menomonee Falls High School. Playing soccer in highschool actually opened up a few opportunities to move for college, but I didn't really see soccer as an endall for myself, and felt stongly about staying in Milwaukee for my undergraduate studies. I'd found the <a href="https://uwm.edu/">University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM)</a> was truly the place for me. They have a great campus right on Lake Michigan, a record of excellence in serving the community and producing very successful members of society, and it was home. And as Dorothy once said, "there's no place like home".

	<h4> Undergrad / Post-graduation </h4>
	<p class="ex1">
		I experienced many challenges in my youth in that my father was largely absent, and my mother struggled to provide for my sister and I. But having faced major adversity during my youth, I learned critical life lessons very early that ultimately saw me pursue education. My undergraduate studies at <a href="https://uwm.edu/">UWM</a> were first distributed among a broad range of topics. As the first member of my family to graduate with a college degree, it was not clear to me what I wanted in return from my schooling other than academic success. At UWM, I originally hoped to pursue a career in law, and so in parallel with my undergraduate classes, I worked at <a href="https://www.lafleurlawfirm.com">La Fleur Law Firm</a> in downtown Milwaukee advancing my professional experience. However, in that legal experience I deternined law wasn’t my passion. My plan of study changed, I enrolled in classes offered through <a href="https://uwm.edu/psychology/">UWM’s psychology program</a> and connected with my readings. In my sophomore year, I met Dr. Deborah Hannula while taking her cognitive neuroscience course. The enthusiasm with which Dr. Hannula taught her class and the topics covered led me to realize cognitive neuroscience was the field of study for me, a field where one can pioneer to ask unanswered questions. By the end of the year, I had landed a research assistant position with Dr. Deborah Hannula’s <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mindfulofmemorylab/home">MINDfull Memory research lab</a>. In Dr. Hannula's lab I learned necessary knowledge to safely and ethically conduct human-subjects research, I developed an understanding for cognitive neuroscience work, and I began to learn the scientific history of human memory.

	<h4> Research Experience - WNL</h4>
	<p class="ex1">
		Fast-foward, I completed my bachelors in <a href="http://uwm.edu/psychology/">psychology</a> at <a href="http://uwm.edu/">UWM</a> in December of 2015. I continued to work at <a href="https://www.lafleurlawfirm.com">La Fleur Law Firm</a> - but as the Firm Administrator - while I searched to  identify professional research opportunities. In July of 2016, I assumed the position of Clinical Research Associate working with <a href="http://david-e-warren.me/index">Dr. David Warren, Ph.D.</a> at the <a href="https://www.unmc.edu/">University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC)</a>. In Dave's lab, I learned in great detail what it meant to be a researcher. There's much more to research than plotting some graphs and mailing them to Elsevier. There I helped establish the groundwork for the lab while advancing my knowledge base in memory research, neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and neurostimulation methods, and strengthening key skills that would later benefit me in my career going forward. After three years working with Dave, I felt that changing my angle on research and broadening my experience would be greatly beneficial for my eventual applications to graduate school.

	<h4> Research Experience - DICON Lab (Present)</h4>
	<p class="ex1">
		In September of 2019, I joined Dr. Tony Wilson's <em><a href="https://diconlab.org/">DICON Lab</a></em> at the Institute for Human Neuroscience. I'm reaching my two-year mark with Tony and can say it's been an awesome experience. I have learned in-depth how to process and analyze Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data, and have helped develop key software tools for the lab to use in our processing pipeline.

	<h4> What's Next? </h4>
	<p class="ex1">
		Firstly, I believe that each of my research experiences thus far has blended exceptionally well, giving framework for a successful career in cognitive neuroscience. I'm currently building my portfolio as I pull together an exciting round of graduate program applications. More to come!

	<h4> Background </h4>
	<p class="ex1">
		I was born and raised in Milwaukee, WI. When I was young I aspired to pursue higher education, but like many others wanting specific academic interests.
		Soccer is a passion of mine and although I had opportunities to play in college, choosing which university to attend was sorta arduous; I had to decide whether to choose a college based on my athletic desires or to choose one in support of my aspirations to become erudite.
		After deliberation, I re-situated myself in Milwaukee and was able to continue playing soccer in college but at the club level. My pursuits ensued at the <a href="http://uwm.edu/">University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM)</a>.

	<h4> Undergrad </h4>
	<p class="ex1">
		Mental illness was no stranger to me growing up; I saw the lives of relatives and a close friend impacted by the same.    My encounters with mental illness gave life to an interest in mental health. Prior to declaring psychology 
		as my undergraduate major of study, my chosen coursework focused on topics in philosophy, italian, anthropology, mythology, and other general studies. 
		For much of my undergrad, I worked in a local law firm in downtown Milwaukee, gaining professional and legal experience as I entertained the idea of law school after college.
		Cue Psychology; my experience in <a href="http://uwm.edu/psychology/">UWM’s undergraduate program through the department of psychology</a> 
		centered my preexisting interests in mental health toward topics of cognition and neuroscience. Admission into Dr. Deborah Hannula’s 
		<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mindfulofmemorylab/home">MINDfull Memory research lab</a> and collaboration with lab members
		routed these interests into a sharpened scope of study. Not unexpectedly, my plans for post-graduation were muddled; I had trouble deciding between law school and graduate school for neuroscience.

	<p class="ex1">
		After completing my bachelors in <a href="http://uwm.edu/psychology/">psychology</a> at <a href="http://uwm.edu/">UWM</a> in December of 2015, 
		I intermitted from school and continued working outside the field of psychology - this was to advance my professional experiences while formalizing a distinct career path. 
		In July of 2016, I was pleased to assume the position of Clinical Research Associate in the <em>Warren Neuroscience Lab</em> – 
		<a href="http://uwm.edu/psychology/">Department of Neurological Sciences</a> at the <a href="https://www.unmc.edu/">University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC)</a> alongside 
		<a href="http://david-e-warren.me/index">Dr. David Warren</a> and the exceptional <a href= "https://www.unmc.edu/neurologicalsciences/about/faculty/index.html">faculty</a>.

	<h4> What's Next? </h4>
	<p class="ex1">
		I am excited for the ongoing mentorship of <a href="http://david-e-warren.me/index">Dr. Warren</a>.
		Under the mentorship of Dr. Warren, I will strengthen my skills with methods in cognitive neuroscience such as eye-tracking and develop new insights into the following: administration of neuropsychological tests of memory, use of various neuroimaging tools and techniques, administration of neurostimulation, and other bits of wisdom sub rosa to the "now". I believe that every step taken and each stage in my life
		furnished a framework for my career in cognitive neuroscience. Until my next big step, I carry on working toward graduate program application. More to come!

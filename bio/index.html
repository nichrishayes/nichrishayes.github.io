	<h4> Background </h4>
	<p class="ex1">
		I was born and raised in Milwaukee, WI. Growing up I aspired to pursue higher education, but like many others I did not have specific academic interests.
		Soccer was a passion of mine and although I received scholarship opportunities to play in college, choosing which university to attend was sorta arduous.
		After deliberation, I situated myself in Milwaukee and continued playing soccer in college but at the club level. Pursuit of education ensued at the <a href="http://uwm.edu/">University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM)</a>.

	<h4> Undergrad </h4>
	<p class="ex1">
		Mental illness was no stranger to me as relatives and a confidant were impacted by the same. My encounters with mental illness gave life to an interest in mental health. Prior to declaring psychology 
		as my undergraduate major of study, my chosen coursework focused on topics in philosophy, italian, anthropology, mythology, and other general studies. 
		For much of my undergrad, I worked in a local law firm in downtown Milwaukee, gaining professional and legal experience as I entertained the idea of law school after graduation.
		Cue Psychology; my experience in <a href="http://uwm.edu/psychology/">UWM’s undergraduate program through the department of psychology</a> 
		centered my preexisting interests in mental health toward topics of cognition and neuroscience. Admission into Dr. Deborah Hannula’s 
		<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mindfulofmemorylab/home">MINDfull Memory research lab</a> and collaboration with the awesome members,
		routed these interests into a sharpened scope of study. Not unexpectedly, my plans for post-graduation were muddled.

	<p class="ex1">
		After completing my bachelors in <a href="http://uwm.edu/psychology/">psychology</a> at <a href="http://uwm.edu/">UWM</a> in December of 2015, 
		I intermitted from school and continued working outside the field of psychology - this was to advance my professional experiences while formalizing a distinct career path. 
		On July 11th of 2016, I was very pleased to assume the position of Clinical Research Associate in the <em>Warren Neuroscience Lab</em> – 
		<a href="http://uwm.edu/psychology/">Department of Neurological Sciences</a> at the <a href="https://www.unmc.edu/">University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC)</a> alongside 
		<a href="http://david-e-warren.me/index">Dr. David Warren</a> and the exceptional <a href= "https://www.unmc.edu/neurologicalsciences/about/faculty/index.html">faculty</a>.

	<h4> What's Next? </h4>
	<p class="ex1">
		I am so excited to continue under the mentorship of <a href="http://david-e-warren.me/index">Dr. Warren</a>.
		Under the mentorship of Dr. Warren, I will be strengthening my skills with eye-tracking methods and learning the following: administration of neuropsychological tests of memory, use of various neuroimaging tools and techniques, administration of neurostimulation – AWESOME!, and other bits of wisdom sub rosa to the now. I believe that every step taken and each stage in my life,
		furnished a framework for my career in cognitive neuroscience. Until my next big step, I carry on working toward graduate program application within the next couple years.

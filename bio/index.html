	<h4> Background </h4>
	<p class="ex1">
		I was born and raised in Milwaukee, WI. I always possessed the desire to attend college but had very little idea of what I wanted to become. 
		Soccer has always been a passion of mine and with a few scholarship opportunities to play in college, choosing which university to attend was sorta arduous. 
		After some consideration, I stayed in Milwaukee near to my family and continued playing soccer in college but at the club level. Also, I had the desire to 
		explore more of my home city as an adult before leaving it. Pursuit of education ensued at the <a href="http://uwm.edu/">University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM)</a>.

	<h4> Undergrad </h4>
	<p class="ex1">
		Prior to declaring psychology as my undergraduate major of study, my chosen coursework focused on topics in philosophy, language, anthropology, mythology, and other general studies. 
		For much of my undergrad, I worked in a local law firm in downtown Milwaukee, gaining professional and legal experience as I entertained the idea of law school after graduation. 
		Cue Psychology; my experience in <a href="http://uwm.edu/psychology/">UWM’s undergraduate program through the department of psychology</a> centered my interests in topics of cognition and neuroscience. 
		Not to make things more difficult, admission into Dr. Deborah Hannula’s <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mindfulofmemorylab/home">MINDfull Memory research lab</a>, and collaboration with the very wonderful graduate and post-doc members, 
		routed these interests into a sharpened scope of practice. Not unexpectedly, my plans for post-graduation were still muddled.

	<p class="ex1">
		After completing my bachelors in <a href="http://uwm.edu/psychology/">psychology</a> at <a href="http://uwm.edu/">UWM</a> in December of 2015, I took time away from school and continued working outside of the field of psychology - 
		this was to advance my professional experiences while formalizing a distinct career path. On July 11th of 2016, I was very pleased to assume the position of Clinical Research Associate in the 
		<em>Warren Neuroscience Lab</em> – <a href="http://uwm.edu/psychology/">Department of Neurological Sciences</a> at the <a href="https://www.unmc.edu/">University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC)</a> alongside 
		<a href="http://david-e-warren.me/index">Dr. David Warren</a> and the exceptional <a href= "https://www.unmc.edu/neurologicalsciences/about/faculty/index.html">faculty</a>.

	<h4> What's Next? </h4>
	<p class="ex1">
		I am so excited to continue under the mentorship of <a href="http://david-e-warren.me/index">Dr. Warren</a> as I have already learned so much in just the first few months here at <a href="https://www.unmc.edu/">UNMC</a>. 
		I will be strengthening my skills with eye-tracking methods and learning the following: administration of neuropsychological tests of memory, use of various neuroimaging tools and techniques, administration of neurostimulation – WOW!, 
		how to work with populations with diagnoses of neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, and I am certain there are other skills not reported here. I believe that every step taken, and each stage, have 
		furnished a framework for my career in cognitive neuroscience as I continue working toward graduate program application within the next couple years.

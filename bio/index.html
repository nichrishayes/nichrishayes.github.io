	<h4> Background </h4>
	<p class="ex1">
		I was born and raised in Milwaukee, WI. I always aspired to attend college and pursue higher education though had very little idea why. 
		Soccer was always a passion of mine and with a few scholarship opportunities to play in college, choosing which university to attend was sorta arduous. 
		After some consideration, I stayed in Milwaukee near to my family and continued playing soccer in college but at the club level. Also, I wanted to 
		experience my home city as an adult before leaving. Pursuit of education ensued at the <a href="http://uwm.edu/">University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM)</a>.

	<h4> Undergrad </h4>
	<p class="ex1">
		Mental illness was no stranger to me as some of my relatives and a close friend from high school were impacted by the same. My encounters with mental illness gave life to an interest in psychology. Prior to declaring psychology 
		as my undergraduate major of study, my chosen coursework focused on topics in philosophy, language, anthropology, mythology, and other general studies. 
		For much of my undergrad, I worked in a local law firm in downtown Milwaukee, gaining professional and legal experience as I entertained the idea of law school after graduation. 
		Cue Psychology; my experience in <a href="http://uwm.edu/psychology/">UWM’s undergraduate program through the department of psychology</a> 
		centered my interests in topics of cognition and neuroscience. Not to make things more difficult, admission into Dr. Deborah Hannula’s 
		<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mindfulofmemorylab/home">MINDfull Memory research lab</a>, and collaboration with the very wonderful graduate and post-doc members, 
		routed these interests into a sharpened scope of practice. Not unexpectedly, my plans for post-graduation were still muddled.

	<p class="ex1">
		After completing my bachelors in <a href="http://uwm.edu/psychology/">psychology</a> at <a href="http://uwm.edu/">UWM</a> in December of 2015, 
		I took time away from school and continued working outside of the field of psychology - this was to advance my professional experiences while formalizing a distinct career path. 
		On July 11th of 2016, I was very pleased to assume the position of Clinical Research Associate in the <em>Warren Neuroscience Lab</em> – 
		<a href="http://uwm.edu/psychology/">Department of Neurological Sciences</a> at the <a href="https://www.unmc.edu/">University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC)</a> alongside 
		<a href="http://david-e-warren.me/index">Dr. David Warren</a> and the exceptional <a href= "https://www.unmc.edu/neurologicalsciences/about/faculty/index.html">faculty</a>.

	<h4> What's Next? </h4>
	<p class="ex1">
		I am so excited to continue under the mentorship of <a href="http://david-e-warren.me/index">Dr. Warren</a> as I already learned so much in just the first few months at <a href="https://www.unmc.edu/">UNMC</a>. 
		I will be strengthening my skills with eye-tracking methods and learning the following: administration of neuropsychological tests of memory, use of various neuroimaging tools and techniques, administration of neurostimulation – AWESOME!, 
		how to work with populations with diagnoses of neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, and I am certain there are other skills not reported here. I believe that every step taken and each stage in my life
		furnished a framework for my career in cognitive neuroscience as I continue working toward graduate program application within the next couple years.
